### Smoking prediction model

This repository contains the code and resources to create a machine learning model to predict an individual's smoking status using bio-signals and other health variables. Smoking has been widely shown to have adverse effects on human health, contributing significantly to preventable disease and mortality worldwide.

#### Description of the problem
Smoking is associated with a wide range of pathological conditions and reduces life expectancy. Despite numerous educational initiatives and evidence-based therapies to stop smoking, quitting remains a challenge for many individuals. This project focuses on the use of biosignal data and health information to predict whether an individual is a smoker or non-smoker.

#### Data used
The dataset comprises several biometric and clinical variables, including:

- **Age**: divided into 5-year age groups
- **Height** (cm) and **weight** (kg)
- **Waist circumference** (cm)
- **Visual acuity** for left and right eyes (missing dioptres)
- **Hearing** for left and right ear (1 - hears well; 2 - hears poorly)
- **Blood pressure** systolic and diastolic
- **Fasting blood glucose** values
- **Lipid values**: total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides
- **Hemoglobin** and other blood values such as creatinine, AST, ALT, GTP
- Proteins in urine
- **Presence of dental caries** **Smoking status
- **Smoker status** (0 non-smoker, 1 smoker) - target variable

#### Methodology
We use machine learning techniques to train and evaluate predictive models. Data are pre-processed to handle missing values, normalized if necessary, and divided into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.

#### Objective
The ultimate goal is to develop an accurate model capable of accurately predicting an individual's smoking status based on biometric and clinical data. This tool could help physicians identify high-risk smokers and improve intervention strategies for smoking cessation.

#### Contributions
Contributions and suggestions are welcome to improve the accuracy of the model and its practical applicability. Our aim is to develop a useful resource for the medical and scientific community engaged in the fight against smoking and its consequences on public health.
